# Overview : Lab 10 Installing and Deploying Software with PDQ
This repository documents my home lab experience focused on Installing and Deploying Software with PDQ using VirtualBox. The lab involves setting up PDQ Deploy and PDQ Inventory to automate software deployment and manage system configurations across multiple virtual machines.

## Objectives
- Learn PDQ Deploy: Explore how to automate the installation of software applications across multiple virtual machines.
- Understand PDQ Inventory: Set up and configure PDQ Inventory for system management and monitoring.
- Network Configuration: Use VirtualBox to simulate a network environment with different configurations and virtual machines.
## Documentation
In this home lab, I will demonstrate how to install PDQ Deploy, create software packages, and deploy them. We will be primarily using Windows Server 2022 for this lab environment. To begin, select Devices at the top of the VirtualBox menu, then choose Insert Guest Additions CD Image.
